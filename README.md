In the distant lands of the kingdom of Pandora, an infinite eclipse is caused by former magical advisor Voldros Salazar, motivated by his insatiable thirst for power. Villages were left in ruins, laws were repealed, the magical council was dismantled, and a great eclipse cast a shadow over the sunlight. However, there are those within the kingdom who hold the potential to reclaim some of Pandora's lost glory. While the eclipse remains fixed in the sky, monsters roam free and chaos reigns through a tragic curse.

Aria is a Witch with expertise in Eletric Magic, giving her many abilities to shoot enemies at midrange and combine with her speed. She can explore the forests of Pandora trying to give hope to her country.

Felix, an ex-military from Pandora army, is a Pyromancy Magic. He is on a revenge path against Voldros since he lost everything in the Eclipse Scam. He uses a powerful blade that combined with his flames turns him a kill machine.

Both have:
Four types of attacks (Mapped to buttons Z,X,C,V).
Dodge abilities (Mapped to F)
Habilities Tree (Can be used in exchange for the collected rings in the pause menu, accessed by the ESC), which can improve its Health, Power, or Dodge ability;
Jump abilities (Felix can jump higher, but Aria has an agile double jump);
